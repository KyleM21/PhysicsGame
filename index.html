				<h1>Welcome!</h1>
				<p>This is a website for an upcoming Physics Game Prototype being developed for our Software Engineering Class!</p>
				<h2>Presentation & Demonstration</h2>
				<p>Coming soon: Powerpoint Presentation with demonstration video.</p>
				<h2>Project Description</h2>
				<p>In this game, players will drive a sled off of a ramp to get to the goal.  There will
					be ways to customize the vehicle which will modify how it moves.  The goal of this project is
					to teach young students how basics physics concepts work, by demonstrating them through a 
					video game.
					<br><br>
					This project is the final project for Software Engineering 1 and UMass Lowell.  The goal
					was to design and create a prototype for a educational game.  Below you find the original
					description of the project.
					<br><br>

				<h2>Domain Research</h2>
				<p>
				PhysicsGame is a Unity engine-based educational video game. PhysicsGame’s application includes 
				the enhancement of understanding of physics concepts for use by students, educators, and parents 
				in the home and school domains. The game is programmed in C# using the Unity game engine and is 
				hosted on GitHub.  <br>By providing the player with the ability to interact with a realistic and 
				directed (AKA ‘guided’ via the use of pop-up hints) physics environment, the player will develop
				an intuitive understanding of the causes and effects of such a system, as well as some of the 
				basics of the underlying mathematics behind it. The system will be presented in a simplified 
				and guided manner.  <br>PhysicsGame is not intended to teach complex nor advanced physics topics 
				or concepts. PhysicsGame is also not intended to be challenging, but rather a guided, casual 
				way to expand one’s basic and beginner physics knowledge.
